# PEELing Web Portal



### Introduction
Molecular compartmentalization is vital for cellular physiology. Spatially-resolved proteomics allows biologists to survey protein composition and dynamics with subcellular resolution. Here, we present **PEELing** (***p***roteome ***e***xtraction from ***e***nzymatic ***l***abel***ing*** data), an integrated package and user-friendly web service for analyzing spatially-resolved proteomics data. PEELing assesses data quality using curated or user-defined references, performs cutoff analysis to remove contaminants, connects to databases for functional annotation, and generates data visualizations—providing a streamlined and reproducible workflow to explore spatially-resolved proteomics data.

This `PEELing` web portal provides an automated, standardized, and easy-to-use analysis pipeline for iPEEL or any other cell-surface proteomics data. PEELing evaluates data quality using curated [Swiss-Prot](https://www.sib.swiss/swiss-prot)  references, performs cut-off analysis to remove contaminants (modified from [Hung et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25002142/) — `PMID:  25002142`), connects to [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) and [Panther](http://www.pantherdb.org/) databases for functional annotation, and generates data visualizations. Together with iPEEL transgenic tools (The Jackson Laboratory: 037697, 037698; Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center: 8763, 9906, 9908), PEELing enables a complete pipeline, from wet lab method to data analysis, for in situ cell-surface proteomics.
